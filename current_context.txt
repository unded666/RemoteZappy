Conversation snapshot — updated 2025-10-20 (latest change: bridge input-forward config)

Repository: RemoteZappy (local path: C:\PersonalProjects\RemoteZappy)
Purpose: PoC to make the Zappy game playable through a browser by adding a WebRTC bridge, frame-push API, and input forwarding.

Key files (roles)
- `main.py`               : The game (pygame) with optional TCP input listener and optional frame-push worker.
- `input_handler.py`      : Keyboard-to-command mapping and command-queue helper used by the game.
- `magic.py`, `spells.json`: Game spell logic and spell definitions.
- `server/bridge.py`      : aiohttp + aiortc media bridge: handles /offer (WebRTC), /framepipe (JPEG frames), and forwards datachannel messages to a configured input target.
- `server/frame_sender_example.py` : Example client that connects to /framepipe and sends JPEG frames.
- `web/index.html`        : Web client page (local webcam + remote video + command buttons + status panel).
- `web/client.js`         : WebRTC client; creates a reliable datachannel `input`, sends keyboard and command JSON messages; updates UI status indicators.
- `scripts/update_current_context.py`: Helper script to append timestamped notes to this context file.

Recent edits (concise chronology)
- Added WebRTC bridge and frame-push API (server/bridge.py) to accept frames and stream to browsers.
- Added an example frame sender (`server/frame_sender_example.py`) for testing /framepipe.
- Web client improvements: command buttons and a small status panel in `web/index.html`; `web/client.js` sends `{type:'command', command:'...'}` over the `input` datachannel and updates status on connection events.
- Game integration: `main.py` already had a local TCP input listener; extended it to accept JSON command lines `{ "type": "command", "command": "fire" }` and post a `pygame.USEREVENT` with `remote_command` so the main thread handles remote commands safely.
- Added `scripts/update_current_context.py` to append short timestamped notes to this file.
- Latest (2025-10-20): `server/bridge.py` now supports environment-driven configuration for input forwarding and framepipe behavior:
  - `INPUT_FORWARD_HOST` and `INPUT_FORWARD_PORT` allow a bridge on Render (or other host) to forward datachannel messages to a remote reachable game server (instead of hardcoded 127.0.0.1:5001).
  - `FRAMEPIPE_ALLOW_REMOTE` (env) toggles whether `/framepipe` accepts remote connections (default is loopback-only). Use with care — consider enabling only with additional auth.

Run / smoke-test notes
- Bridge (Render or Linux host) should be started with a command binding to the service port, e.g.:
  python server\bridge.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
- If bridge is remote and the game lives on another reachable server, set in the bridge's environment:
  INPUT_FORWARD_HOST=<game-public-ip>
  INPUT_FORWARD_PORT=5001
  FRAMEPIPE_ALLOW_REMOTE=1   # only if the game needs to push frames remotely
- On the game host, point the game to the bridge's `/framepipe` (if using frame push):
  FRAMEPIPE_URL=wss://<bridge-host>/framepipe
  python main.py

Security & recommendations
- Don't enable `FRAMEPIPE_ALLOW_REMOTE` without adding authentication. If you want, I can add a `FRAMEPIPE_SECRET` env var check (the frame client must include the secret when connecting) — I recommend doing that if hosting the bridge publicly.
- Ensure `INPUT_FORWARD_HOST` points to a reachable, properly firewalled host. If your game is behind NAT or local only, prefer hosting both bridge + game on the same cloud VM (simplest).

Next suggested actions (pick one)
- I can add `FRAMEPIPE_SECRET` authentication to `/framepipe` (quick, recommended if you enable FRAMEPIPE_ALLOW_REMOTE).
- I can draft a short Render.com service configuration checklist (exact UI fields and sample env values) so you can deploy the bridge on Render easily.
- I can add a small log/visual in the game to confirm remote command receipt.

Change log (automated)
- 2025-10-20T00:00:00Z — Updated context to record bridge env-configurable forwarding and recent web/client/game edits.
- 2025-10-20T00:05:00Z — Added server/start-all.sh (wrapper to run headless game + bridge), updated server/Dockerfile to copy the script and install minimal SDL/Xvfb libs, added /healthz endpoint to server/bridge.py, and added pygame to requirements-poc.txt so the combined Docker image can run the game headless.
