Conversation snapshot — updated 2025-10-20 (latest change: web UI status panel)

Repository: RemoteZappy (local path: C:\PersonalProjects\RemoteZappy)
Purpose: PoC to make the Zappy game playable through a browser by adding a WebRTC bridge, frame-push API, and input forwarding.

Summary of workspace (key files/folders)
- main.py               : The game (pygame) with optional TCP input listener and optional frame-push worker.
- input_handler.py      : Keyboard-to-command mapping and command-queue helper used by the game.
- magic.py, spells.json : Game spell logic and spell definitions.
- server/bridge.py      : aiohttp + aiortc media bridge that accepts /offer (WebRTC) and forwards datachannel messages to local TCP server; provides /framepipe websocket for pushed JPEG frames.
- server/frame_sender_example.py : Example client that connects to /framepipe and sends JPEG frames (for testing bridge frame-push).
- web/index.html        : Web client page (local webcam + remote video + command buttons + status panel).
- web/client.js         : WebRTC client code; sends webcam, creates a reliable datachannel named 'input', sends keyboard events and command JSON messages over it; updates UI status indicators.
- icons/, gestures/     : Game assets and gesture tooling (gesture studio external package referenced).
- current_context.txt   : This file (concise runtime/conversation snapshot, kept current).

Recent changes in this conversation (concise)
- Added a small status panel in `web/index.html` showing WebRTC connection state, datachannel state, and the last command sent.
- Wired the status UI in `web/client.js`: updates on connection/datachannel events and when command buttons are clicked.
- Previously implemented: bridge, framepipe, frame_sender_example, command buttons, datachannel forwarding, and game-side TCP command handling/USEREVENT injection.

What I implemented in this session (full chronology)
1) server/bridge.py: WebRTC bridge, /offer, /framepipe; forwards datachannel messages to local TCP port 5001; loopback-only framepipe by default; --allow-framepipe-remote CLI flag added.
2) server/frame_sender_example.py: frame-push test client producing JPEG frames.
3) web/index.html: added command buttons and, now, a status panel.
4) web/client.js: sends keyboard and command JSON messages over a reliable datachannel; now updates the status panel; buttons provide visual feedback and set `last command`.
5) main.py: extended local TCP input listener to accept {"type":"command","command":"..."} lines and post thread-safe pygame.USEREVENT events processed on the main thread; fixed input handling branch order.
6) current_context.txt: updated (this file) after each meaningful repo change; will continue to be updated whenever edits occur as a result of this conversation.

Run / smoke-test instructions (local dev)
Prereqs: Python 3.10+, venv with required packages installed (aiortc, av, aiohttp, Pillow, pygame, etc.)

1) Start the bridge server (example):
   python server\bridge.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

2) Start the game locally (enable input listener so the bridge can forward commands):
   set INPUT_LISTEN_PORT=5001
   set FRAMEPIPE_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8080/framepipe   # optional
   python main.py

3) Open the web client in a browser pointed at the bridge host (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/) and click Start; grant webcam access.
   - After the WebRTC connection establishes, clicking command buttons will send JSON command messages -> bridge -> 127.0.0.1:5001 -> game.
   - Status panel will show connection and datachannel state; Last command will show the most recent command sent.

Design notes & safety
- The /framepipe endpoint is intended for loopback use; the bridge rejects remote connections by default. Use --allow-framepipe-remote only when you understand the security tradeoffs.
- The bridge forwards the raw datachannel payload to a local TCP listener without authentication; this is a PoC convenience mechanism. For production, add authentication and message validation.

Conversation / work state
- The core PoC (browser → WebRTC/datachannel → bridge → local TCP → game) is implemented and wired. The web UI now includes status feedback.
- Static checks in this environment may flag missing packages (pygame, aiortc, etc.). Those are environmental and don't indicate repository logic errors.

Next recommended steps (I can do now if you want)
- Create an automated headless test script to exercise the datachannel -> bridge -> game path (useful for CI / regression checks).
- Add a small visual indicator in the game or logs when a remote command is applied, to help debugging remote clients.
- Add a minimal docker-compose and README for a Linux host deployment (bridge + optional game runner).
